###Some project recommendations:
In order to improve the code quality please use any code linter [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) as an example.
It's a good practice to document the code. If there is some complex logic, leave the comment there and explain **why** you wrote it. 
Try to keep your components clean as mush as possible. If it's possible - move logic/calculations to services/utilities functions.
